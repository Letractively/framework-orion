ORION is a project developed at UNIRIO (Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro) aiming to facilitate ontology refinement.

To acomplish its tasks, ORION uses the Theory Revision System FORTE (developed by Bradley L. Richards of the Department of Computer Science at University of Texas) and the JENA Api (http://jena.sourceforge.net/).
